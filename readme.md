**Caution** - PCB layout/schematic is currently untested.

## Housing

The front panel was machined by [Schaeffer AG](http://www.schaeffer-ag.de/) and designed in their Front Panel Designer software. The design is also available in SVG and DXF formats (exported from FPD) both with and without reference points in the hope that they might be useful. They are handy in that the text output is in the form of a single, clean path.
